CocoaMobileDevice
=================

A Cocoa based wrapper around the libmobiledevice library.

This is very much a work in progress. Will update the repo when I have something releasable.


This will only work if you have the libmobiledevice compiled and installed to /opt/local at the moment. When i can figure it out, i will add a script to compile and configure but for now, see this guide http://nicodepoel.com/blog/tag/usbmuxd/
